# Internet & World Wide Web (WWW)

# Web Browser 

- The web browser is an application software used to explore the World Wide Web (WWW). 
- It acts as a platform that allows users to access information from the Internet by serving as an interface between the client (user) and the server. 
- The browser sends requests to servers for web documents and services, then renders the received HTML content, including text, images, links, styles, and scripts.

# How does Web Browser Works 

- When a user accesses a website by typing a URL like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ into the browser, 
- the browser first contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the domain name into an IP address, such as 52.85.142.233.
- After obtaining the IP address, the browser sends a request to the corresponding web server.
- The web server processes this request and responds with the required content, including HTML, CSS, images, and scripts.
- The browser then uses this content to display the webpage to the user.

- A browser helps us find information anywhere on the internet. It is installed on the client's computer and requests information from the web server; such a type of working model is called a client-server model.

- The browser receives information through HTTP protocol. In which transmission of data is defined. When the browser received data from the server, it is rendered in HTML to user-readable form and, information is displayed on the device screen.
