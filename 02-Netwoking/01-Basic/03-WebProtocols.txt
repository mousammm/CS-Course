# Web Protocols

- Protocol: A protocol is a set of predefined rules that handle how data is exchanged between computers over the Internet.
- It ensures that devices can communicate in a structured, reliable, and secure manner.
- In essence, protocols dictate how data is sent, received, formatted, and processed.

- While there are over 200 recognized protocols in use today across various domains like networking, security, and applications, 
- more than 90% of internet communication relies on a few key protocols—
- HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, FTP, and DNS—commonly known as web protocols. 
- Without these protocols, devices wouldn't be able to understand each other, rendering online communication impossible.

# Web Protocols Models 
1. OSI

2. TCP/IP

- Web protocols operate seamlessly across the TCP/IP model to enable efficient and reliable communication between devices on the internet. 
- The TCP/IP model, which is a more practical and simplified version of the OSI model, consists of four layers: 
- the Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer, and Network Access Layer.
- Unlike the OSI model, which separates responsibilities into seven layers, TCP/IP combines several OSI layers into broader functional blocks.

How data is transferred in tcp/ip model - 

- When data is transmitted from a sender to a receiver, 
- the process starts at the Application Layer, 
- where protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and DNS initiate and manage the communication. 
- The data is then passed to the Transport Layer, which uses protocols such as TCP or UDP to segment the data into packets and ensure it reaches the destination reliably and in order.
- Next, the Network Layer assigns IP addresses and determines the best routing path using protocols like IP and ICMP.
- Finally, the Network Access Layer manages the physical transmission of data through hardware-specific means such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi,
- handling MAC addresses and converting data into signals that travel through the network medium.
