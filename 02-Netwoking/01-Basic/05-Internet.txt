# Introduction to Internet

- A network is a group of two or more computer systems (Multiple gadgets, additionally called hosts), 
- which are related through a couple of channels for the motive of sending and receiving data (records/media) in a shared environment.
- The community also can consist of serval gadgets/mediums that resource communique among or extra machines; 
- those gadgets are called Network devices and consist of routers, switches, hubs, and bridges, amongst others.

What is Internet?

- Internet is a group of computer systems connected from all around the world.
- The Internet protocol suite is a framework defined through the Internet standards. 
- Methods are divided right into a layered set of protocols in this architecture.
- The Internet provides a huge variety of statistics and communique offerings, which include forums, databases, email, and hypertext. 
- It is made of the neighbourhood to global personal, and public networks connected through plenty of digital, wireless, and networking technologies.

Working of the Internet:

- The internet is a global computer network that connects various devices and sends a lot of information and media.
- It uses an Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP)-based packet routing network. 
- TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, regardless of the device or location. 
- Data is delivered across the internet in the form of messages and packets. 
- A message is a piece of data delivered over the internet, but before it is sent, it is broken down into smaller pieces known as packets.

- IP is a set of rules that control how data is transmitted from one computer to another via the internet. 
- The IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred using a numerical address (IP Address). 
- The TCP is used with IP to ensure that data is transferred in a secure and reliable manner.
- This ensures that no packets are lost, that packets are reassembled in the correct order, and that there is no delay that degrades data quality.

# History of Internet

- Talking about the history of internet, the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, later renamed the internet)
- established a successful link between the University of California Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969. 
- Libraries automate and network catalogs outside of ARPANET in the late 1960s.

- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) is established in the 1970s, allowing internet technology to mature. 
- The development of these protocols aided in the standardization of how data was sent and received via the internet. 
- NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network), the 56 Kbps backbone of the internet, was financed by the National Science Foundation in 1986.
- Because government monies were being used to administer and maintain it, there were commercial restrictions in place at the time.

- In the year 1991, a user-friendly internet interface was developed. 
- Delphi was the first national commercial online service to offer internet connectivity in July 1992. 
- Later in May 1995, All restrictions on commercial usage of the internet are lifted.
- As a result, the internet has been able to diversify and grow swiftly. 
- Wi-Fi was first introduced in 1997.
- The year is 1998, and Windows 98 is released.
- Smartphone use is widespread in 2007. The 4G network is launched in 2009. 
- The internet is used by 3 billion people nowadays. 
- By 2030, there are expected to be 7.5 billion internet users and 500 billion devices linked to the internet.

# Common Terms Used in Internet

1 Web 1.0: The Beginning of the Internet
Web 1.0, which emerged with the invention of the Internet, featured static web pages that could only be viewed. These early websites were essentially digital brochures, with limited interactivity and no ability for users to contribute content. This era saw the rise of early browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, which made it easier for users to access the Web.

2 Web 2.0: The Era of Social Media and User-Generated Content
Web 2.0, which emerged during the "Internet Boom" era of the late 1990s and early 2000s, introduced more dynamic web pages and websites, and allowed for user-generated content. This era saw the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, as well as the introduction of blogs, wikis, and other forms of user-generated content.

3 Web 3.0: The Future of the Internet
Web 3.0, which is still in development, promises to bring a more personalized and intuitive experience for users. It is expected to be more intelligent and able to understand the context and intent of the user's actions. This will be achieved through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies.
