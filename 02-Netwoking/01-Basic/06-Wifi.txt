# Types of Wi-Fi Connections

- LAN (Local Area Network)
- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)

# How does a Wi-Fi work?

- Wi-Fi is a wireless technology for networking, 
- so it uses Electromagnetic waves to transmit networks. 
- We know that there are many divisions of Electromagnetic waves according to their frequency such as 
- X-ray, Gamma-ray, radio wave, microwave, etc, 
- in Wi-Fi, the radio frequency is used. For transmitting Wi-Fi signal there is three medium, 

    - Base Station Network or an Ethernet(802.3) Connection: It is the main host network from where the network connection is provided to the router.
    - Access Point or Router: it is a bridge between a wired network and a wireless network. It accepts a wired Ethernet connection and converts the wired connection to a wireless connection and spreads the connection as a radio wave.
    - Accessing Devices: It is our mobile, computer, etc from where we use the Wi-Fi and surfing internet.

- All the electronics devices read data in binary form, also router or our devices, 
- here routers provide radio waves and those waves are receive by our devices and read the waves in binary form.
- We know how a wave looks like a upper pick of the wave is known as a 1 and the lower pick of the wave is known as the 0 in a binary as mentioned below :

    * SSID (Service Set Identifier): This 32 character name that identifies the Wi-Fi network and differentiates the one Wi-Fi from a another Wi-Fi. All the devices are attempting to connect a particular SSID. A SSID is the name of a wireless network.
    * WPA-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access- Pre-Shared Key): The program developed by Wi-Fi Alliance Authority to secure a wireless networks with a use of a Pre Shared Key authentication. The WPA has a 3 types such as WPA, WPA2 and a WPA3. It is a way of encrypting a Wi-Fi signal to protect from a unwanted users.
    * Wi-Fi uses Ad-Hoc networks to transmit. It is a point-to-point network without any interface
