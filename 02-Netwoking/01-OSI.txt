# What is OSI Model? 7 layers 

- its more of a theoritical layer 
- higher layer dont worry about down layer 

- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.
- OSI Model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
- The OSI Model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities.
- This layered approach makes it easier for different devices and technologies to work together

# Layers of the OSI Model

% Physical Layer
% Data Link Layer
  Sublayers of Data Link Layer
    Logical Link Control (LLC)
    Media Access Control (MAC)
  Functions of the Data Link Layer
    - Framing
    - Physical Addressing 
    - Error Control 
    - Flow Control
    - Access Control

% Network Layer
  Functions of the Network Layer
    - Routing
    - Logical Addressing

% Transport Layer
  Functions of the Transport Layer
    Segmentation and Reassembly
    Service Point Addressing
  Services Provided by Transport Layer
    Connection-Oriented Service
    Connectionless Service

% Session Layer
  Functions of the Session Layer
    - Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use, and terminate a connection.
    - Synchronization: This layer allows a process to add checkpoints that are considered synchronization points in the data. These synchronization points help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely, and data loss is avoided.
    - Dialog Controller: The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full duplex. 

% Presentation Layer
  Functions of the Presentation Layer
    - Translation: For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.
    - Encryption/ Decryption: Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the ciphertext, and the decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.
    - Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network. 

% Application Layer
  Functions of the Application Layer
    - Network Virtual Terminal (NVT): It allows a user to log on to a remote host.
    - File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM): This application allows a user to access files in a remote host, retrieve files in a remote host, and manage or control files from a remote computer.
    - Mail Services: Provide email service.
    - Directory Services: This application provides distributed database sources and access for global information about various objects and services

# How Data Flows in the OSI Model?

- When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model.
- First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender's end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver's end.
- Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:
