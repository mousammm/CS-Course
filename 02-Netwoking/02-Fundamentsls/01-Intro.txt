# Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks

- Network: A group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share data with each other.
- Node: Any device that can send, receive, or forward data in a network. This includes laptops, mobiles, printers, earbuds, servers, etc.
- Networking Devices: Devices that manage and support networking functions. This includes routers, switches, hubs, and access points.
- Transmission Media: The physical or wireless medium through which data travels between devices.
- Wired media: Ethernet cables, optical fiber.
- Wireless media: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared
- Service Provider Networks: Networks offered by external providers that allow users or organizations to lease network access and capabilities. This includes internet providers, mobile carriers, etc.

# How Does a Computer Network Work
- Network Node: Any device in a network, such as a modem, router, or computer, that sends or receives data.
- Link: The medium that connects nodes, like cables, wires, or wireless signals.
- Working: Networks use rules called protocols to send and receive data between devices. Each device is identified by a unique IP Address.
- Firewall: A security tool (hardware or software) that monitors traffic. Based on set rules, it either allows, blocks, or drops data.

# Types of Computer Network Architecture

- Client-Server Architecture:in which Nodes can be Servers or Clients. Here, the server node can manage the Client Node Behaviour.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture: there is not any concept of a Central Server. Each device is free for working as either client or server.

# Network Devices

- An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts,
- that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.
- Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices;
- these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges. 

1. Router
    Connects multiple networks (like home network to the internet).
    Directs data packets to their correct destination.

2. Switch
    Connects devices within a network (like computers in an office).
    Forwards data only to the specific device it is meant for.

3. Hub
    Basic device that connects multiple devices in a network.
    Sends data to all devices (less efficient than a switch).

4. Bridge
    Connects and filters traffic between two networks or segments.
    Helps reduce network traffic.

5. Gateway
    Connects two different types of networks.
    Translates data between different protocols.

6. Access Point (AP)
    Provides wireless connectivity to devices.
    Extends a wired network into a Wi-Fi network.

7. Modem
    Converts digital data from a computer into signals for phone/cable lines and vice versa.
    Provides internet access.

8. Firewall
    Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    Provides security by blocking unauthorized access.
