# Network Devices

- Network devices are fundamental hardware components in computer networking that operate across different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models.
- They facilitate data transmission, regulate traffic flow, provide interconnectivity between heterogeneous networks, and enforce security policies

Common Networking Devices

1. Access Point (AP)
    -Creates a wireless local area network (WLAN).
    -Allows wireless devices (smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) to connect to a wired network.

2. Modem
    - Stands for Modulator/Demodulator.
    - Converts digital signals from computers into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines, cable systems, or wireless media, and vice versa.
    - Acts as the primary internet access device for users.

Types of Modems:
    DSL Modem: Uses telephone lines, slower than cable.
    Cable Modem: Uses TV cables, faster than DSL.
    Wireless Modem: Provides internet via Wi-Fi.
    Cellular Modem: Uses mobile data networks.

3. Firewall
    - A security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    - Blocks unauthorized access while allowing trusted data.
    - Can be hardware-based, software-based, or cloud-based.
    - Protects against hackers, malware, and cyber threats.

4. Repeater
    - Operates at the Physical Layer of the OSI model.
    - Regenerates and amplifies weak signals to extend network range.
    - Commonly used in large LANs or WANs to solve signal attenuation issues.

5. Hub
    - A multiport repeater used in star topology networks.
    - Broadcasts data to all connected devices, regardless of the destination.
    - Inefficient compared to switches due to collisions.

Types of Hubs:
    - Active Hub: Boosts signals, acts as a repeater.
    - Passive Hub: Relays signals without amplification.
    - Intelligent Hub: Provides monitoring and management functions.

6. Bridge
    - Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
    - Connects and filters traffic between two LAN segments.
    - Uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended segment.

Types of Bridges:
    - Transparent Bridge: Learns MAC addresses automatically.
    - Source Routing Bridge: Follows routes specified by the sender.

7. Switch
    - An advanced form of a bridge with multiple ports.
    - Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and selectively forwards packets.
    - Reduces collisions by creating separate collision domains.

Types of Switches:
    - Unmanaged Switches: Plug-and-play, simple use.
    - Managed Switches: Supports VLANs, QoS, link aggregation.
    - Layer 2 Switches: Forward frames within the same network.
    - Layer 3 Switches: Perform routing between different networks.
    - PoE Switches: Provide power and data through the same cable.
    - Gigabit Switches: Support high-speed Ethernet.
    - Modular Switches: Expandable and customizable for large networks.

8. Router
    - Operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3).
    - Uses IP addresses to route data between different networks (LAN to WAN).
    - Maintains a routing table to decide the best path.
    - Divides broadcast domains for better efficiency.

9. Gateway
    - Acts as a protocol converter.
    - Connects two networks using different architectures or protocols.
    - Can work at any OSI layer depending on its function.
    - Examples: connecting an enterprise LAN to the internet.

10. Brouter (Bridging Router)
    - A hybrid device with features of both a Bridge and a Router.
    - Works at Data Link Layer (as bridge) and Network Layer (as router).
    - Routes packets between networks and filters traffic within LANs.

11. NIC (Network Interface Card)
    - A hardware adapter that enables a computer to connect to a network.
    - Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
    - Has a unique MAC address for identification.
    - Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
