# Types of Network 

- A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media.
- Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network

# Geographical Area

1. Personal Area Network (PAN)

- PAN is the most basic type of computer network. 
- It is a type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person.
- It allows your personal devices, like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables, to communicate and share data with each other.
- PAN offers a network range of 1 to 10 meters from person to device providing communication.
- Its transmission speed is very high with very easy maintenance and very low cost.

    Examples of PAN are Bluetooth connection between a phone and wireless earbuds , Infrared communication between TV and remote.

2. Local Area Network (LAN)

- It is a computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally. 
- A LAN encompasses two or more computers connected over a server. 
- The two important technologies involved in this network are Ethernet and Wi-fi.
- It ranges up to 2km & transmission speed is very high with easy maintenance and low cost.

    Examples of LAN are Wi-Fi in a home or school, wired LAN in a company's office.

3. Campus Area Network (CAN)

- CAN is bigger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN.
- This is a type of computer network that is usually used in places like a school or colleges.
- This network covers a limited geographical area that is, it spreads across several buildings within the campus.
- CAN mainly use Ethernet technology with a range of few kilometers. 
- Its transmission speed is very high with a moderate maintenance cost and moderate cost.

    Examples of CAN are networks that cover schools, colleges, buildings, etc.

4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) 

- A MAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
- This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area.
- This network mainly uses FDDI, CDDI, and ATM as the technology with a range from 5km to 50km.
- Its transmission speed is average. 
- It is difficult to maintain and it comes with a high cost.

    Examples of MAN are networking in towns, cities, a single large city, a large area within multiple buildings, etc.

5. Wide Area Network (WAN)

- WAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path.
- It is not restrained to a single location but extends over many locations.
- WAN can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other with a range above 50km.
- Here we use Leased-Line & Dial-up technology.
- Its transmission speed is very low and it comes with very high maintenance and very high cost.

    Examples of WAN are the Internet (largest WAN), Banking networks linking global branches

# Transmission Technology

1. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) :

- WLAN is a type of computer network that acts as a local area network but makes use of wireless network technology like Wi-Fi.
- This network doesn't allow devices to communicate over physical cables like in LAN but allows devices to communicate wirelessly. 

    Most common example of WLAN is Wi-Fi.

2. System Area Network (SAN)

- A System Area Network is designed to connect high-performance computers within a localized, high-speed environment, 
- such as in data centers or supercomputing facilities.
- A SAN provides access to block-level data storage.

    Examples of SAN are a network of disks accessed by a network of servers.

3. Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)

- A POLAN is a type of computer network that is an alternative to a LAN.
- POLAN uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from a single strand of single-mode optical fiber to multiple signals to distribute users and devices. 
- In short, POLAN is a point to multipoint LAN architecture. 

# Ownership and Access Control

1. Private Network

- These are networks completely owned and managed by a single organization or individual.
- The owner controls who can connect, what they can do, and how data moves within the network.
- Since there is no outside access, they are highly secure and reliable, often protected by firewalls and strict policies.

    Examples:
        A company’s internal office network (Intranet)
        School or college campus networks
        Hospital systems storing patient data

2. Public Network

- These are networks open to the general public and are usually provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or businesses in public places.
- They offer basic or no authentication, making them less secure and vulnerable to attacks if not used carefully.
- Examples: Public Wi-Fi at cafes or airports, free hotspots in city centers, Internet (the largest public network).

3. Hybrid Network

- A hybrid network blends private and public access, offering flexibility and role-based access control.
- Some parts are restricted (like internal systems), while others are open (like guest Wi-Fi).
- This setup is useful in environments where different users need different access levels.
- Example: A university network with private access for staff and students and limited access for guests.

# Internetwork

- An internetwork is a setup where two or more networks (like LANs or WANs) are interconnected using routers or gateways, 
- allowing communication between them.

1. Intranet

- An intranet is a private network used within an organization.
- It allows employees to access internal tools, documents, and systems securely.
- It's not available to the public, and typically uses private IP addresses.
- Examples: Company HR portals, Internal knowledge bases, Staff-only communication tools.

2. Extranet

- An extranet is an extension of the intranet that provides limited, secure access to outsiders such as partners, vendors, or clients.
- It's used to collaborate across organizations while maintaining internal security.
- Examples: Supplier portals, Client dashboards for project updates, Partner login systems for shared services
