# Types of Network Topology

- A network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a computer network.
- It shows how computers, servers, and other devices are connected and how data flows between them.
- There are two main types of topology:

    - Physical Topology: The actual physical layout of cables and devices.
    - Logical Topology: How data moves across the network, regardless of physical layout.

1 P Topology

- Point-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver.
- one is the sender and the other one is the receiver.
- Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth

2 Mesh Topology

- In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel.
- Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels.
- These channels are known as links.
- In Mesh Topology, the protocols used are AHCP (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocols),
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), etc.

3 Star Topology

- In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.
- This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node.
- The hub can be passive in nature i.e., not an intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices,
- at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as an active hub.
- Active hubs have repeaters in them. 

4 Bus Topology

- Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable.
- It is bi-directional.
- It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.
- In Bus Topology, various MAC (Media Access Control) protocols are followed by LAN ethernet connections like TDMA, Pure Aloha, CDMA, Slotted Aloha, etc. 

5 Ring Topology

- it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices.
- A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes,
- because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes,
- then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.

- the Token Ring Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data where,
- Token passing is a network access method in which a token is passed from one node to another node & Token is a frame that circulates around the network. 

6 Tree Topology

- Tree topology is the variation of the Star topology.
- This topology has a hierarchical flow of data.
- In Tree Topology, protocols like DHCP and SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration) are used.
- Here, various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater.
- This data flow from top to bottom i.e. from the central hub to the secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e. devices to the secondary hub and then to the central hub. 

7 Hybrid Topology

- Hybrid Topology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above.
- Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form.
- It means these can be individuals such as Ring or Star topology or can be a combination of various types of topologies seen above.
