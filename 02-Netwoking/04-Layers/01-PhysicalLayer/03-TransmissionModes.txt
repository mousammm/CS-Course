# Transmission Modes in Computer Networks (Simplex, Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex)

- Transmission modes also known as communication modes,
- define how data is transferred between devices in a network or bus system.

# Simplex Mode

- the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.
- Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit,
- the other can only receive.
- The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.

# Half-Duplex Mode

- each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
- When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.
- The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time.

# Full-Duplex Mode

- both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.
- It is used when communication in both directions is required all the time.
- The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions.
- Here, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction,
- this sharing can occur in two ways: 
    - Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.
    - Or the capacity is divided between signals traveling in both directions.
