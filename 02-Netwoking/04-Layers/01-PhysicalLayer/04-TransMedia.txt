Transmission Media in Computer Networks

- Transmission media is the physical medium through which data is transmitted from one device to another within a network.
- These media can be wired or wireless.
- The choice of medium depends on factors like distance, speed, and interference.

#. Guided Media

- Guided Media is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media.
- Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links.
- There are 3 major types of Guided Media: Twisted Pair, Coaxial and Optical Fiber Cables

Features:
    High Speed
    Secure
    Used for comparatively shorter distances

1 Twisted Pair Cable

(a) Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP): It is used for telephonic applications. k
(b) Shielded Twisted Pair (STP): It is used in fast data rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines. 

2 Coaxial Cable

- The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: 
- Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and
- Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges)
- Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables

3 Optical Fiber Cable

- The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode. 

4 Stripline
5 Microstripline

#. Unguided Media

- It is also referred to as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media . No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals. 

Features:
    The signal is broadcasted through air
    Less Secure
    Used for larger distances

1 Radio Waves

- Radio waves are easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings.
- The sending and receiving antennas need not be aligned.
- Frequency Range: 3KHz - 1GHz3KHz - 1GHz. AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission.

Types of Radio Waves:
    Short Wave: AM Radio
    VHF (Very High Frequency): FM Radio/TV
    UHF (Ultra High Frequency): TV

Radio Wave Components:
    Transmitter: Responsible for encoding the signal.
    Receiver: Responsible for decoding the signal.

2 Microwaves

- It is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other.
- The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna.
- Frequency Range:1GHz - 300GHz.
- Micro waves are majorly used for mobile phone communication and television distribution. 

3 Infrared

- Infrared waves are used for very short distance communication.
- They cannot penetrate through obstacles.
- This prevents interference between systems.
- Frequency Range:300GHz - 400THz. It is used in TV remotes, wireless mouse, keyboard, printer, etc. 

# Causes of Transmission Impairment

    Attenuation:
- Loss of signal strength as it travels over distance due to resistance of the medium.
- Amplifiers are used to restore the signal.

    Distortion:
- Change in the shape of a signal, usually in composite signals with different frequencies.
- Since each frequency travels at a different speed, they reach the receiver at different times, causing phase shifts and distortion.

    Noise:
- Unwanted signals that mix with the original signal, potentially corrupting it.
- Common types include induced noise, crosstalk, thermal noise, and impulse noise.

Transmission Media  Application

Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP): Local Area Networks (LAN), telephones
Shielded Twisted Pair (STP): Industrial networks, environments with high interference
