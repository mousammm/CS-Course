# Sub-Layers of The Data Link Layer

    Logical Link Control (LLC):
- This sublayer of the data link layer deals with multiplexing,
- the flow of data among applications and other services,
- and LLC is responsible for providing error messages and acknowledgments as well. 

    Media Access Control (MAC):
- MAC sublayer manages the device's interaction,
- responsible for addressing frames, and also controls physical media access
- The data link layer receives the information in the form of packets from the Network layer,
- it divides packets into frames and sends those frames bit-by-bit to the underlying physical layer. 

# Protocols in Data link layer
    - Synchronous Data Link Protocol (SDLC)
    - High-Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC)
    - Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP)
    - Point to Point Protocol (PPP)
    - Link Access Procedure (LAP)
    - Link Control Protocol (LCP)
    - Network Control Protocol (NCP)

# Devices Operating at the Data Link Layer
1. Switch
2. Bridge
3. Network Interface Card (NIC)
4. Wireless Access Point (WAP)
5. Layer 2 Switches

# Applications of Data Link Layer

    Local Area Networks (LANs)
    Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)    
    Switches and MAC Addressing
    Point-to-Point Connections
