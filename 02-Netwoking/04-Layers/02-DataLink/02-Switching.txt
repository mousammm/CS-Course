Switching | Computer Networks

- Switching is the process of transferring data packets from one device to another within the same network or across networks using switches.

# Network Switching

- Network Switching is a specific type of switching, used in computer networks.
- It is about transferring data packets from one device (node) to another across a network.

It involves the following steps:
- Frame Reception: Switch receives a frame from a device.
- MAC Address Extraction: Reads the destination MAC address from the frame.
- Lookup: Searches its switching table for the destination MAC address.
- Forwarding: If found, sends the frame to the correct port. If not found, uses flooding (sends to all ports except incoming one).
- Table Update: Learns new MAC addresses and updates the table for future forwarding.
- Frame Transition: Forwards the frame to the correct device/network

# Types of Switching

There are three types of switching methods:
    Message Switching
    Circuit Switching
    Packet Switching

# Virtual LAN (VLAN)

- A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical segmentation of a Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
- network that enables devices to be grouped together regardless of their physical location.
- Unlike traditional LANs that rely on physical topology, VLANs are implemented in switches using IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging.

    - Same VLAN: Devices can communicate directly within the VLAN.
    - Different VLANs: Communication requires Inter-VLAN Routing (using a router or Layer 3 switch).
