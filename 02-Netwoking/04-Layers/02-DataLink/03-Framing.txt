# Framing in Data Link Layer

- A frame consists of a sequence of bits organized into a structured block that conveys data along with control information such as addressing and error detection codes.
- dividing the continuous stream of bits into manageable, meaningful chunks that can be reliably transmitted and processed by the receiver.

Types of Framing

1. Fixed-Size Framing
2. Variable-Size Framing
