# Physical Layer in OSI Model

- The physical layer has one job:
- to transmit a stream of raw,
- unstructured bits from one device to another.

It is not responsible for:
    What the bits mean.
    If they are in the correct order.
    If some bits are missing.
    The source or destination of the bits.

Its only concern is with the physical connection and the representation of the 1s and 0s on the medium.

# Functions of Physical Layer

-  The Physical Layer is responsible for sending raw data as bits over a physical medium.
- It converts data into signals that can travel through wires, fiber optics, or wireless channels (encoding) and turns these signals back into data at the receiver (decoding).
- It ensures signals are transmitted correctly and uses techniques like modulation to prepare the data for transmission and demodulation to retrieve it at the other end.
- This layer also decides how data flows (one-way, two-way alternately, or simultaneously) through transmission modes and controls the speed and timing of data transmission to keep everything running smoothly.

# Physical Topologies

1. Representation of Bits (Signaling)

- This is the most fundamental question:
- How do you represent a '1' and a '0' in the physical world?
- The answer is by creating a signal with a specific property that can be changed.
- This is called modulation.

Electrical Voltage (Copper Wires):
  - +5 volts might mean a 1.
  - -5 volts might mean a 0.
  - Example: Ethernet over twisted-pair cable.

Light Pulses (Fiber Optics):
  - Presence of light (LED or Laser on) means a 1.
  - Absence of light (LED or Laser off) means a 0.
  - Example: Fiber optic internet connections.

Radio Waves (Wireless):
  - Changes in the phase, frequency, or amplitude of the radio wave represent 1s and 0s.
  - A specific frequency shift might mean a 1, while another means a 0. This is how Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work.

Microwaves (Satellite): Similar to radio, but at higher frequencies.

#. Physical Components & Hardware

- Network Interface Card (NIC): 
- Wireless Access Point (WAP): 
- Repeaters and Hubs: 
- Hub 

# line configuration 

-point-to-point configuration:c arrying the data between two devices.
-multi-point configuration: multiple devices are connected. 

# Transmission Mode (Duplex)

 - Simplex: One-way communication only (e.g., a keyboard to a computer, a traditional TV broadcast).
 - Half-Duplex: Two-way communication, but only one direction at a time (e.g., a walkie-talkie, old hub-based networks).
 - Full-Duplex: Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., a telephone conversation, a modern switch-based network).

# Types of Network Topology

- Layer on is just connection of 2 device 
- here we see how diff device can be connected

% Physical Topology: The actual physical layout of cables and devices.
% Logical Topology: How data moves across the network, regardless of physical layout.

1 P Topology
2 Mesh Topology - protocols AHCP, DHCP
3 Star Topology - hubs 
4 Bus Topology - MAC address > lan ethernet connnection like > TDMA, CDMA
5 Ring Topology
6 Tree Topology - protocols DHCP, SAC
7 Hybrid Topology

# protocols in physical layer

- the classic osi model can be a bit misleading here.
- unlike higher layers (like tcp/ip or http)
- the physical layer (layer 1) doesn't have "protocols"
- in the same sense of structured packets with headers and data that make decisions.

think of it this way:
    a protocol like tcp has a "conversation" ("i got your packet," "please resend that," "we're closing the connection").

    a physical layer standard is more like the laws of physics for the connection: "a '1' will be represented by a light pulse of this specific wavelength lasting exactly 0.0000001 seconds."

so, the "protocols" you're looking for are these official standards. let's dive into the major ones.

    ethernet (ieee 802.3) : widely used for wired networks.
    wi-fi (ieee 802.11) : for wireless communication.
    bluetooth (ieee 802.15.1) : short-range wireless communication.
    usb (universal serial bus) : for connecting devices over short distances

the physical layer is this combination of:
- functions: bit representation, synchronization, physical topology, transmission mode.
- components: nics, cables, connectors, repeaters, hubs.
- standards/protocols: ieee 802.3 (ethernet), ieee 802.11 (wi-fi), dsl, sonet/sdh, usb.
- Deep Technical Concepts: Clock recovery, baseband vs. broadband, multiplexing (FDM, TDM, WDM), and the difference between line coding and modulation.
