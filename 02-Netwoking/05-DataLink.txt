
It take a packet from network layer 
adds its own header & trailer
create a Frame 
frame is send to physical layer

# Sub-Layers of The Data Link Layer
- Logical Link Control (LLC): It deals with protocols, flow-control, and error control
- Media Access Control (MAC): It deals with actual control of media

# DLL is implemented in NIC > every NIC has a MAC ADDRESS > OS provides drivers for NIC
# MAC Address (media access control)
- A MAC address is a 48 or 64-bit address associated with a network adapter
- first half (24 bits) ID number of the adapter manufacturer
- second half (24 more bits) represents the serial number assigned to the adapter by the manufacturer

# Protocols in Data link layer
- Synchronous Data Link Protocol (SDLC)
- High-Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC)
- Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP)
- Point to Point Protocol (PPP)
- Link Access Procedure (LAP)
- Link Control Protocol (LCP)
- Network Control Protocol (NCP)

# Devices Operating at the Data Link Layer
1. Switch
2. Bridge
3. Network Interface Card (NIC)
4. Wireless Access Point (WAP)
5. Layer 2 Switches

# Applications of Data Link Layer
- Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)    
- Switches and MAC Addressing
- Point-to-Point Connections

# Function

  % Framing
    - byte stuffing  used
    - Bit stuffing
  
  % Error detection 
    - Parity
    - CheckSum
    - CRC used
  
  % Flow Control & error control
    Automatic Repeat Request
    - stop and wait       |
    - Go back n           |- SLIDING WINDOW
    - selective repeat    |
  
  % Multiple Access
    - ALOHA
    - CSMA/CD  used

# Transmission delay: time taken by sender to put data packet on channel  
# Propogation delay: time taken by the last bit of data packet to reach receiver 
# Queuing Delay: time it waits in a queu
# Processing delay: encription decritpion

# Error and flow control

happen in dll and trans layer 
dll: device are close to each other speed/bandwidth is high
transport: speed/bandwidth may vary aq to link too much delay

Why do these layer need error contorl
- transport layer works on top of IP
- IP is connection less not reliable 
- So the TCP has to ensure that these pkt of ip layer go in particular order and if loss it should handle apporptialy

- dll works on top of physical layer 
- physical layer might cause some damages to bits 
- it happen a lot in wireless
