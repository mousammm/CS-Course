#1 Network layer

Switch > Router > Internet > Server
Router and Internet are a part of Autonomous sustem(ISP)

- Network layer routes packets from source to destination within or outside a subnet
- Two different subnet may have different addressing schemes or non-compatible addressing types.
- Same with protocols, two different subnet may be operating on different protocols 
- Network layer has the responsibility to route the packets from source to destination, mapping different addressing schemes and protocols.
- Data from the transport layer is encapsulated into packets, with source and destination IPs attached.

- Network address is always configured on network interface card 
- and is generally mapped by system with the MAC address

#2 Protocols 
- Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP)
- Internet Protocol(IP)

#3 Function
- Internetworking
- Addressing 
- Routing and Forwarding 
- Scability(using hirerchy in networks)
- Bandwidth control
- Fragmentation and Re-assembly

#4 circuit switching and packet switching
- network layer TCP/IP model uses > packet switching > datagram
- data is always divided into packets 

$ circuit switching - thery concept / used in telephone  networks
- establish a connection 
- used that conection
- close that connection
- bandwidth is allocated which is used in connection making
- and release that bandwidth

$ Packet switching
- divide ur input data into multiple packet
- and these packet go through multiple router 
- routers use store and forward switching 
- and that utilize the bandwidth more efficiently
- and is called statistical multiplexing
  $.1 Virtual circuit
    Connection required
    Routing happen per connection
    Packets have circuit identificaton
    Faliurs are difficult to handle
    quality of service is easy to add
  $.1 DataGram
    Connection not required
    Routing happen per circuit
    Packets have destination address
    Faliurs are easy to handle
    quality of service is difficult to gurantee

#5 Classful Addressing
- ip/ipv4 are 32 bit address
- 2^32 address 4.3 billion
  cider
  classless addressing
  net 

CLASS A: begins with 0
  8bits for network (2^7 total network)
  24bits for host (there are 2^24 - 2)
  
  10.0.0.0 - firt address in this particular address
  10.255.255.255 - firt address in this particular address
  110.0.0.0 - firt address in this particular address
  
  RANGE: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255

CLASS B: begins with 10
  16bits for network (2^14 total network)
  16bits for host (there are 2^16 - 2)
  
  RANGE: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

CLASS C: begins with 110
  24bits for network (2^21 total network)
  8bits for host (there are 2^8 - 2)
  
  RANGE: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

CLASS D: begins with 1110 RANGE: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
CLASS E: beigns with 1111 RANGE: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

#5.1 NAT(Network Address Translation)

Class C networks is been used 
- ISP provides you a wifi access point with the router 
- devices at home get class c address

- laptop1 192.0.0.1
- laptop2 192.0.0.2                |                  |
- laptop3 192.0.0.3      private <-| router 182.23.2.1 |-> public   -----> Internet 
- laptop4 192.0.0.4                | NATBOX change    |
- laptop5 192.0.0.5                | private-> public |

#6 Subnetting

- Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller networks called subnets.
- Each subnet provides its own space for devices to communicate, improving network performance, security, and management.

- With Subnetting, we split the network into three subnets, 
      device    IPs Allocated (after subnetting)
