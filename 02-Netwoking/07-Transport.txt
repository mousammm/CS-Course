# Transport layer

- ur web server might be running diff processes
- and ur cmpt might be doing different things 
- there are multiple application running 

- It provides process to process communication 
- Port Numbers

- Network layer makes sure packet reach webserver
- but which process is going to consume this packet > handed by TL

PORT NOS: 16 unsinged int 
- o to 1024 
80 HTTP
443 HTTPS
53 DNS
22 SSH
110 POP3
25 SMTP

- TL is implemented in the os 
- os provide the facility to have port no 
- and these lib they provide lib fun useing the sys calls of os 
- bind asscept socket all these are provided by the os > these are part of the TL

# TL PROTOCOLS
TCP / UDP
UDP: wrapper over the ip protocol

# TCP connection oritented protocol 
- when browsing some website 
- using internet layer > TCP on top > u make a TCP connection
- And this connection happens using socket api

# web server 
- socket() creates a socket = ip address + port no
- binds() the socket to a port no
- listen() using it shows its willing ness to accept connections
- accept() to accept connection (infinite loop)

Browsr site 
- socket() create a socket when it wants to create a connection to a webserver
- connect() when is been accept down in accept of webserver 
- now browser and webserver is connected using TCP connection
- AND this connection is 3 way handshake
- once connection establish they both 
    - read()
    - write()

- close()

# 3-Way Handshake

The 3-Way Handshake ensures both client and server are ready before data transmission begins:

Step 1: SYN → (Client → Server)
    Client sends a TCP segment with SYN=1, including its ISN (Initial Sequence Number).
    Marks the request to initiate a connection

Step 2: SYN‑ACK ← (Server → Client)
    Server replies with SYN=1 & ACK=1, containing its own ISN and ACK = client_ISN + 1.
    Confirms receipt of client’s SYN and initiates its own sync 

Step 3: ACK → (Client → Server)
    Client sends an ACK=1 segment with ACK = server_ISN + 1.
    Completes synchronization; connection enters ESTABLISHED state
