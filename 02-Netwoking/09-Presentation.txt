- Solution: Presentation Layer standardizes everything into network-ready format so differences become invisible.
- It doesn't change the meaning of the data (that's Application Layer), but it changes the representation to make it secure, efficient, and universally understandable
- Transform data from Application layer that can be read by 
- windows linux mac 
- converting data into standard form where all can under stand

- Compression: Reduces data size for faster transmission.
- Encryption/Decryption: Protects data from unauthorized access.
- Format Translation: Converts application-specific data into a standard format.
- Compatibility: Makes communication possible between different operating systems and platforms.

1. Format Translation in Action:
 JSON/XML/ASN.1 - Standard data formats everyone understands
 Character encoding - ASCII → Unicode (so English and Chinese characters can coexist)
 Byte order - Little-endian (Intel) vs Big-endian (Network) conversion

2. Encryption - The Most Visible Part
 Application Layer: "Here's my login password"
 Presentation Layer: *encrypts with SSL/TLS*
 Network: "garbled_encrypted_data"
 Presentation Layer: *decrypts at destination*
 Application Layer: "Here's my login password" 

# Protocols
- SSL/TLS libraries (OpenSSL) = Presentation Layer encryption (SSL/TLS display "HTTPS" in their URLs instead of "HTTP," indicating that communications are encrypted and secure.)
- Compression libraries (zlib, gzip) = Presentation Layer compression
- Serialization formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers) = Presentation Layer translation
- Character encoding (UTF-8) = Presentation Layer compatibility
