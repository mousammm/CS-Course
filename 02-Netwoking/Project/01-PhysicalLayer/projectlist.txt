Project 1: Build Your Own Ethernet Cable & Sniffer
What you'll need:
    RJ45 connectors
    Ethernet cable
    Crimping tool
    Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)
    Breadboard and wires

What you'll learn:
    How 1s and 0s become voltage changes
    Manchester encoding (how clocks sync)
    Collision detection (CSMA/CD)
    Actual electrical signaling

Project 2: DIY Radio (WiFi/Bluetooth at Physical Layer)
Build a Simple SDR (Software Defined Radio):

apt install gqrx

What you'll see:
    WiFi channels as actual frequency ranges
    Bluetooth packets as radio bursts
    AM/FM radio - understand modulation
    How digital data becomes radio waves

Hardware options:
    RTL-SDR ($20) - USB TV tuner that can receive 24MHz-1.7GHz
    HackRF One ($300) - Transmit AND receive
    ADALM-PLUTO ($200) - Lab-grade SDR

Project 3: Build a Simple Network from SCRATCH
Two Arduino Communication

What you'll implement:
    Your own framing (like Ethernet frames)
    Your own error detection (like CRC)
    Your own collision avoidance
    Your own physical protocol

Project 4: Visible Light Communication (Li-Fi)
Send data with LIGHT:

What you'll learn:
    Modulation techniques
    Signal-to-noise ratio
    How fiber optics work (but with visible light)

Project 5: Analyze Actual Network Signals

With Oscilloscope ($50-100 used):
    Watch Ethernet cable signals - see the actual voltage changes
    Measure timing - see how fast bits actually transmit
    Understand noise - see how signals degrade over distance

Project 6: Build a Simple PHY Chip Emulator
Implement Manchester Encoding

Beginner Path ($25 total):
    Get RTL-SDR dongle ($20)
    Install SDR# or gqrx (free)
    Tune to WiFi frequencies (2.4GHz) - just to SEE the spectrum
    Listen to FM radio - understand how modulation works

Option 1 (Software Approach):
sudo apt install wireshark

Option 2 (Hardware Approach - Recommended):
Order an RTL-SDR dongle ($20 on Amazon) and start seeing the actual radio spectrum.
