1. Network Protocol Analysis with Wireshark
    What: Capture and analyze real Ethernet frames
    How: Install Wireshark (free), capture traffic, and examine:
        MAC addresses in frame headers
        Different frame types (ARP, Ethernet II)
        Error detection mechanisms
        Frame sizes and structure
    Skills: You'll literally see Layer 2 in action!

2. ARP Table Exploration
    What: Play with Address Resolution Protocol (bridges Layer 2 and 3)
    How: Use command line:
    bash
arp -a                    # View ARP table
ping [IP]                # Generate ARP traffic
arp -d *                 # Clear ARP cache (watch it repopulate)
Learning: See how IP addresses map to MAC addresses

3. Virtual Network Simulation
    What: Create virtual networks to test Layer 2 concepts
    Tools:
        Cisco Packet Tracer (free with NetAcad account)
        GNS3 (open source)
    Projects:
        Connect multiple virtual devices in a LAN
        Observe MAC address tables in switches
        Create and analyze VLANs

4. Raspberry Pi Network Tap
    Cost: ~$35 for Pi Zero + Ethernet adapter
    What: Build a simple device that monitors network traffic
    Learning: Understand how frames move through a physical network

5. Managed Switch Exploration
    Cost: Find a cheap used managed switch (~$20-50)
    What: Configure and explore:
        MAC address tables
        VLANs (Virtual LANs)
        Port security
        Spanning Tree Protocol basics

6. Simple Frame Generator
    Language: Python with scapy library
    What: Programmatically create and send custom Ethernet frames
    Learning: Understand frame structure by building it yourself

7. MAC Address Changer
    What: Write a script to change your network interface's MAC address
    Learning: Understand how MAC addressing works at the software level
    Note: Only do this on your own test network
