int s = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);  = it return 3 

The File Descriptor Sequence:
Your program starts with 3 standard FDs already open:
FD 1: stdout  (already open when program starts)
FD 2: stderr  (already open when program starts)
FD 3: your socket ← Next available!

When you create new resources (sockets, files, pipes), the OS gives you the next available number:
if FD 3 was higher, it would mean you already opened other resources
Resource management: Each FD represents a system resource

Creates a real socket object in kernel memory
Finds the first empty slot in YOUR program's table
Puts the socket in that slot
Returns the slot number (3) to you

Now when you say:
bind(s, ...);     // OS looks in slot 3 to find the real socket
listen(s, ...);   // OS looks in slot 3 to find the real socket  
accept(s, ...);   // OS looks in slot 3 to find the real socket
