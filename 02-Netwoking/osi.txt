# Protocols - set of used by 2 devices to communicate 
- every protocol have predefine headers 
- which define how a message should be
- details of the message 

SENDER - attaches header 
RECEIVER - processes the header

NOTE: All protocol are implemented in certain layer 

# How to manage Protocols > Layering > organised these protocols

OSI model - theoritical
- Application     http
- Presentation    http + h
- Session         http + h + h
- Transport       http + h + h + h
- Network         http + h + h + h + h
- Data link       http + h + h + h + h + h
- Physical        0 and 1

- Data link layer can be understand by receiver DLL
- receiver processes the dll of sender and pass the process data to upper layer
- this is called encapsulation

- physical layer: sharing of bits 0s 1s 
- data link layer: one device to one device communication
- Network: for connection of device not directly connected to you
    OSI:It may provide relible and un reliable services
    TCP/IP:It provide unreliable services

- Transport: 
    network layer sends data from one device to other
    but they might be running diff processes
    cmpt might be running the browser, email, remoteLogin
    transport layer: which process should be receiving these info 

- Session: it does session management, authentacition
    combining of diff steames 
    audio video img all in one

- Presentaion: data compression/encoding/decoding/encription/decription
- Application: Run browser all other things

TCP/ip - used
                                              PDUs
- link layer: Physical + data link          Frames      Wifi/Ethernet
- network: unreliale, uses IP protocol      Packets     IP
- Transport: UDP/TCP                        Segment     TCP
- Application: Browsers etc                 Message     http
