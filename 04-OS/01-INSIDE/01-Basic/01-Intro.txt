# Operating Sysytem 
- manages system and hardware resorces
- responisble for sharing of computer resources among different running application
- includes processor memory file management 
- acts a government for your system that has different departments to manage different resources
- acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. 
- In short its an interface between computer hardware and user. 
- provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. 
- (OS) is a program that runs at all times on a computer. All other programs, including application programs, run on top of the operating system.
- It does assignment of resources like memory, processors and input / output devices to different processes that need the resources. The assignment of resources has to be fair and secure.

# Os and User Interaction
- An operating system is always running in the background to manage and coordinate the use of hardware resources among system and application programs for multiple users.
- The OS is not itself just a user interface. Instead, it provides an interface for user interaction, typically through:
    - Command-Line Interface (CLI), via shells and terminal commands.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI), through windows, icons and menus

# Kernel 
- At the core of the OS lies the Kernel, which is the primary interface between hardware and software 
- which handles low-level operations such as process management, memory management, file system control and device handling.

# Goals of Os
- The primary goals of an operating system (OS) are to provide a easy to use and convenient environment for executing user programs.

    User Convenience : It should be easy to use, providing a user-friendly interface and making it simple to interact with the system.

    Program Execution: It facilitates the execution of user programs, providing the necessary environment and services for them to run.

    Resource Management: The OS manages and allocates the computer's resources, including the CPU, memory, disk storage and input/output devices, to ensure fair utilization.

    Security: The OS protects the system and user data from unauthorized access, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information

    Efficient Resource Utilization: It should aim to maximize the performance and utilization of computer resources like CPU, Memory and IO devices, ensuring that the system runs smoothly and efficiently.

    Reliability: It should be robust and reliable, able to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, ensuring that the system continues to operate smoothly. It should be modular in design and easy to debug.
