# What is Software?
- Software/Computer Software refers to the collection of instructions, data, or programs that are used to operate computers and execute specific tasks

# History of Computer Software

1940s Development of early computers ENIAC and EDSAC.

1950s High-level Languages
    FORTRAN: For scientific and engineering calculations
    COBOL: For business applications
    LISP: For AI research

    IBM's OS/360 developed.
    Multics Project laid the groundwork for Unix.

1970s Expansion of High-level Languages and Unix
    Unix was developed.
    C programming language was created.
    DBMSs such as those using SQL emerged.

1980s Personal Computing and Graphical User Interfaces
    MS-DOS became a standard operating system for IBM PCs.
    Apple introduced the Macintosh with GUI.
    Microsoft Windows was invented.
    Spreadsheet software Lotus 1-2-3 was invented.
1990s Internet and Open Source
    WWW was developed.
    Linux emerged as a powerful OS.
    Java programming language was developed.
    Microsoft released Windows 95.

2000s Web 2.0 and Mobile Computing
    Cloud computing services began with Amazon AWS.
    The iPhone was introduced in 2007.

2010s

    Mobile apps have become ubiquitous.
    AI and machine learning saw significant advancements.

2020s
Cloud Native and Quantum Computing
    Quantum computing software started to develop.
    Cloud-native applications started to become more popular.

# Types of Computer Software

1. System Software
- System software manages hardware and basic system operations and serves as a foundation for application software. It serves as a bridge between hardware and use r and ensures that the system operates efficiently and effectively. This includes Operating Systems, Device Drivers, and Utility Software.

2. Application Software
- Application Software refers to the programs designed to perform specific tasks for end-users such as web browsing, gaming, word processing, etc. This includes Productivity Software (Microsoft Office, Google Workspace), Database Software (MySQL, Oracle Database), Communication Software (Slack, Skype), and Graphics Software (Adobe Photoshop, CoralDraw).

3. Development Software
- Development Software includes tools and environments that are used by developers and programmers to create, debug, and maintain software applications. This includes IntegerateDevelopmentnt Environments (Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studio), Code Editors (Atom, Visual Studio Code), and Version Control Software (Git, GitHub).

4. Business Software
- Business Software refers to the applications that assist organizations in managing their operations, improving productivity, and facilitating various business activities. This includes Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Accounting Software (QuickBooks, Xero).

5. Embedded Software
- Embedded software is computer software that is designed to operate hardware and perform specific tasks within a larger system. It is optimized for particular functions and integrated into the hardware it controls. This includes Firmware (BIOS in computer) and Control Systems (Software in automotive control systems).

# How Does Computer Software Work?
    - Coding: Software developers write the instructions using programming languages like Java, Python, etc. These instructions are in the form of algorithms and logic to achieve specific tasks.
    - Compilation/ Interpretation: Depending upon the programming language the code is either compiled or interpreted. Programming languages like C, C++, and C# in which code is compiled and programming languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby in which code is interpreted.
    - Execution: Once the software is compiled/ interpreted, it can be executed by the CPU. The CPU reads and executes the machine instructions generated from the code.
    - Interaction: The software interacts with OS and hardware to perform tasks as instructed.
    - Output: The software produces output based on its instructions which may include generating reports, controlling hardware devices, etc.
