# Difference Between 32-bit and 64-bit Operating Systems

-  A 32-bit system can access 2^32 different memory addresses, i.e. 4 GB of RAM or physical memory. Ideally, it can access more than 4 GB of RAM also. 

- A 64-bit system can access 2^64 different memory addresses, i.e. actually 18-quintillion bytes of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it.

- A computer with a 64-bit processor can have a 64-bit or 32-bit version of an operating system installed. However, with a 32-bit operating system, the 64-bit processor would not run at its full capability

# Difference Between x64 and x86 Architecture

x64 ( same x86_64)
- x64 is a 64-bit structure that extends the x86 structure. The time period "x64" is frequently used interchangeably with "x86-64" or "AMD64" because it became advanced with the aid of AMD as an extension of the x86 structure. Later, Intel observed this model, calling it "Intel sixty-four" or "IA-32e". This 64-bit structure was introduced to remedy the limitations of the 32-bit x86 architecture.
        x64 processors are backwards like minded with 32-bit software programs; This means you could run all 32-bit software and sixty-four-bit applications on x64 CPUs. However, 64-bit processors can take advantage of 64-bit software and running structures for higher normal overall performance and support more reminiscence.

x86
- The time period "x86" in the beginning mentioned Intel 8086, 80286, 80386, and so forth. Refers to Intel's own family of generation microprocessors, which include This machine includes a training set (ISA) containing a 32-bit reference and facts course. The x86 architecture has a long record relationship lower back to the early Nineteen Eighties and has long passed via many revisions and upgrades.
        One of the important thing functions of the x86 structure is its compatibility with older software and hardware variations. Many packages and modules evolved for x86-primarily based architectures will keep running on modern-day x86 processors, together with sixty-four-bit processors. At the same time, this backward compatibility has introduced main upgrades to the x86 architecture.
