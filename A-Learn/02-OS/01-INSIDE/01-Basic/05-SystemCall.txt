# System Call

- a programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system on which it is executed

# System Calls are,
    - A way for programs to interact with the operating system.
    - Provide the services of the operating system to the user programs.
    - Only entry points into the kernel and are executed in kernel mode.

# How do System Calls Work?

- A system call allows a program to request services from the operating system.
- It can be written in high-level languages (C, C++, Pascal) or in assembly.
- When a program makes a system call, it switches to kernel mode.
- The OS handles the request, performs the task (e.g., file access, process control), and returns the result.
- Without system calls, each program would need its own way to access hardware, making systems inconsistent and error-prone.

# Types of System Calls

- File System: Used to create, open, read, write, and manage files and directories.
  - open()
  - close()
  - read()
  - write()
  - seek()
 
- Process Control: Used to create, execute, synchronize, and terminate processes.
  - fork()
  - exec()
  - kill()
 
- Memory Management: Used to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory for processes.
  - brk()
  - sbrk()
  - nmap()
  
- Interprocess Communication (IPC): Used for data exchange and communication between different processes.
  - pipe()
  - socket()
 
- Device Management: Used to request and release devices, and to perform read/write operations on them.
  - setConsoleMode()
  - WriteConsole()
  - Open()
  - Close()
