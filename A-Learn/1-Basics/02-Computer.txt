# What is a Computer ?
- It takes input 
- Processes it using c Central processing Unit (CPU)
- Stores info
- Produce output

# Types of computer ?
- Desktop
- Laptop 
- Servers [provides services to other network]

# How does hardware communicate with software ?
When you give input (e.g., typing a letter on a keyboard)
- the hardware (keyboard) sends input to the software. 
- The software then converts the input into a machine-readable language (binary) that the CPU can process. 
- The output (e.g., the letter ‘A’) is then displayed on the screen as a result of this process.

# What is a Software?

- Software is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do when to do, it and how to do it. 
- An interpreter is responsible for converting the software’s human-readable code into machine language (binary code) that the CPU understands and executes.

# Types of Hardware:

- Central Processing Unit (CPU) - Executes instructions and performs calculations.
- Memory (RAM) - Temporarily stores data that the CPU needs during operation.
- Storage Devices (HDD/SSD) - Store data permanently, even when the computer is turned off.
- Input Devices - Allow users to interact with the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
- Output Devices - Display or produce results of the computer’s processing (e.g., monitors, printers).
