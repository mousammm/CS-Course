# Variables in C

- a named piece of memory which is used to store data 
- and access it whenever required. 
- It is important to initialize a variable it only contains garbage value when it is declared. 
- When a variable is declared, the compiler is told that the variable with the given name and type exists in the program.
- But no memory is allocated to it yet. Memory is allocated when the variable is defined.

int num = 10;

- store a value of 10 in memory
- we can access it by num
- int = how much size num can hold
