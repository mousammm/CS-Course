# Data Type (int num = 10;)

- int tell what kind of data num is holding 
- it 

		Basic Data Type (int/float/double/char/bool/void)
Data Type C     Derived Data Type (array/pointer/function)
		User Defined Data Type (Union/struct/enum)

# int(4bytes) %d
	1bytes  =  8bit                    
	4bytes  =  4x8bit      (32)        
	2^32    =  4294967296              
	2^32/2  =  2147483648
	(-2147483648-2147483648)

#  char    (1bytes)  %c
#  float   (4bytes)  %f
#  double  (8bytes)  %lf
#  void    (nooooo)  lol

# sizeof(int) to know the size of data types

- long, short, signed and unsigned are datatype modifier 
- used with some primitive data types to change the size or length
