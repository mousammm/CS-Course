# Setup() - The "New Game" Function:
- Set gameOver to false.
- Set direction to STOP so the game doesn't start moving immediately.
- Put the snake head in the middle of the map.
- Place the first fruit at a random location.
- Reset the score and tail length to zero.

void setup() {
    gameOver = false;
    dir = STOP;
    headX = wallWidth / 2;
    headY = wallHeight / 2;

    fruitX = rand() % wallWidth;
    fruitY = rand() % wallHeight;

    score = 0;
    nTail = 0;

    // Initialize tail arrays
- we ini the tailX/Y with -1 
- as these just store the cordinates for the snake body
- by ini with 0 we set the snake body at 0th cordinate 
- -1 is safe as thre is no - codintates for our game
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_TAIL; i++) {
        tailX[i] = -1;
        tailY[i] = -1;
    }
}

# Additionally  <ctime.h>
// Initialize random seed
srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(nullptr)));
