# Input() - The "Listener" Function:
- Check if a key has been pressed with _kbhit().
- If it has, read the key with _getch().
- Change the dir variable based on the key (W, A, S, D). But be smart! Don't let the snake turn directly back onto itself (e.g., from UP to DOWN)."
- Also, listen for 'X' to quit and 'P' to pause."

        switch (_getch()) {
